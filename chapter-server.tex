\section{Application Programming Interface Endpoints}

Micromeda server provides several endpoints for providing information about individual genome properties and accessing information stored in supplied Micromeda files. These endpoints utilize GenomePropertiesResultsWithMatches objects generated from uploaded Micromeda files and methods there in to provide web applications about these file's datasets. These endpoints and their implementation
