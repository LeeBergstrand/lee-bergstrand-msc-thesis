\chapter{Development of a Web-Based Visualization Tool for the Comparison of Organism Genome Properties}

As discussed in Chapter XXX, Micromeda's web visualizations interface consists of a web client backed by a separate server process. This server provides a series of web API endpoints (Section XXX) from which the client can acquire data about the genome properties possessed by multiple organisms. The role of the client is to visualize this data and provide a user interface for exploring it. The client is capable of visualizing data from uploaded Micromeda files. As discussed in Section XXX, these file contain not only property and step assignments for multiple organisms but also the protein sequences and domain annotations used to make these assignments. The client provides a way to upload these files to the server in addition to its visualization capability. In this chapter we will discuss the client web application in detail.
